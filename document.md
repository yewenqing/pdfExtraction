Foundation Studies
Programs, Streams & Courses

Programs

Foundation Studies Programs provide academic preparation for
undergraduate study and are designed for international students. The
programs are delivered in lecture and tutorial format along with practical
laboratory, workshop and studio classes as well as weekly consultations
with the instructor. A Student Progress Coordinator will be monitoring
student progress and will be able to provide students with individual
study advice and tips throughout the duration of their program.

On completion of a Foundation Studies program, students are
awarded a Foundation Studies Certificate, which is accepted by
UNSW and all Australian universities for undergraduate entry. Academic
standards and results in the programs are approved and monitored by
UNSW and its Faculties. The Certificate is accompanied by a Statement
of Results.

There are three main Foundation Studies programs.

The Standard Foundation Program is delivered over 9 months.

The Standard Plus Foundation Program is delivered over 12 months and
designed for students who require a more gradual introduction to their
studies.

The Transition Program is a 4-month, one-term program designed for
international students who have completed a previous high school
matriculation program and have academic results just below that
required for direct entry to UNSW.

Streams and Courses

Within each Foundation Studies Program, students must choose a
Stream (set program of courses) determined by their desired university
program.

The Transition Program offers the Physical Science, Life Science,
Commerce, Design and Actuarial Streams only. Streams and courses at
Foundation Studies Kensington campus are shown in Table 1.

All streams contain five to seven courses; each course has a unit of
credit weighting. Students usually take a minimum of 48 units of credit.

Transition Program

The Foundation Studies Transition Program is a one-semester program, designed for international students
with strong English skills (IELTS score of 6.0 or greater) and Academic results just below that required for
direct university entry.

Upon successful completion of the T2 and T3 programs, a student can begin undergraduate studies at the
beginning of the following year. The next available UNSW intake for T1 students is the Mid-Year intake (UNSW
Session 2). Some university programs are not offered Mid-Year.

Only Physical Science, Life Science, Commerce, Commerce Actuarial and Design streams are offered in the
Transition program. These core streams of study will allow entry to all UNSW undergraduate degrees.

Grading System

Grading System

Students in each course are allocated a final mark out of 100 and a corresponding final letter grade on an A to
F scale. Each letter grade has an associated grade point on a 10-point scale. Overall performance is expressed
as a weighted grade point average (GPA) out of 10, based on all units attempted.

Table 11: Grade-Point-Average Calculation

A typical GPA calculation is shown for a student in the Commerce Stream.

Course grades are described in Table 10 below. A typical GPA calculation is shown in Table 11.

Minimum Age Policy &
Students Under 18 Years of Age

All students should check the UNSW website to
confirm their undergraduate degree will commence in
time for the completion of their Foundation Studies
program as on some occasions there may be term
delay between the completion of Foundation Studies
and commencement of an undergraduate program.

Permanent Resident (PR) and Australian
Citizen Status

Students who have Permanent Resident (PR) or
Australian citizen status can complete a Foundation
Studies program. Foundation Studies policies, rules
and regulations apply to all students irrespective
of their nationality or residency status. The normal
tuition fee applies.

Students who change their status from that of
international student to PR or Australian citizen, must
notify the UNSW College Student Enquiries Office and
also the Student Wellbeing Advisers immediately.
Failure to do so may affect university admission.

Based on the Foundation Studies results, PR and
Australian Citizen students may apply for a university
place. Application is made through the Universities
Admissions Centre (UAC), along with all other
Australian citizens sitting final exams such as the
NSW Higher School Certificate. Entry levels that apply
for New Year and Mid-Year entry are determined by
UAC at the time of each intake and are dependent
on the availability of places. The GPA requirements
for UNSW may be higher and sometimes lower than
that of international students for some programs.
The Student Wellbeing Advisers will hold meetings to
advise PR and Australian Citizens of the procedures
for admission to university through UAC.

Please note that some universities will only accept
the Foundation Studies Certificate for entry from
international, non-resident students.

The University of New South Wales accepts the
Foundation Studies Certificate for entry from
international students and Australian Citizens or
Australian Permanent Residents.

Please note that in some Faculties, there are NO
Commonwealth Supported Places - CSP (previously
known as HECS places) available for students in
Term 2 or 3 because they have all been allocated to
students in the Term 1 intake.

Not all UNSW undergraduate programs are offered in
Terms 2 and 3.

Minimum Age Policy

Foundation Studies has a policy with regard to the
minimum age of students accepted into the program,
for the issue of provisional offers to UNSW and the
approval of care and welfare arrangements. This
policy is as follows:

•

•

Foundation Studies will not accept students
unless they will be at least 16 years of age at the
commencement date of their Foundation Studies
program.

This policy would also apply to external
campuses conducting Foundation Studies
programs.

Students Under 18 Years of Age

For international students, it is a condition of their
student visa to either:

1.  Reside with a parent or close relative over 21

years of age who has been approved by the
Department of Home Affairs (DHA) as their
carer/guardian

or

2.  To have their care, accommodation and welfare
arrangements approved by Foundation Studies.

Under 18 students, who have been issued with CAAW
by UNSW College must follow a set of rules to ensure
their safety and wellbeing. For more information,
refer to Section 3 Under 18 Students in the handbook
on page 63.

Student
Responsibilities

Follow the UNSW College Student Code
of Conduct

The UNSW College Student Code of Conduct serves
as a guide to help all students understand the
expectations for their behavior whilst enrolled at the
College.

It outlines the standards for academic integrity,
respect for others, and the consequences for actions
that go against these principles.

Here are the key purposes:

Promote a positive learning environment.
The code ensures that everyone in the school
community can learn and work in a safe, respectful,
and supportive atmosphere.

Define Acceptable Behaviour.
It clearly states what is considered appropriate and
inappropriate behavior, helping students know how to
act responsibly and respectfully towards others.

Protect the Rights of All Students.
By setting out rules, the code helps protect students
from discrimination, harassment, bullying, and other
forms of misconduct.

Encourage Responsibility and Accountability.
It teaches students to take responsibility for their
actions and understand the consequences of
breaking the rules.

Support Academic Integrity.
The code includes guidelines on academic honesty,
such as prohibiting cheating or plagiarism, to ensure
fairness and integrity in academic work.

By understanding and following the Student Code of
Conduct, students can contribute to a positive and
productive College experience.

Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025Check Your UNSW Student Email Daily

UNSW and UNSW College communicate with students via email. Official
communication with students will always be via their UNSW student
email account. UNSW College will use the student’s official GID email
address to contact them.

It is the student’s responsibility to check their official UNSW student
email account regularly for important information. Ignorance is no
excuse if relevant information and details have been sent to them by
email, or handed out at lectures or on the website.

Provide Your Current Address Details

Students must inform us within 7 days of their arrival in Australia of their
correct residential address and phone contact details and must advise
any later changes of address or contact details within 7 days. This is a
condition of their student visa.

Students must do this online at https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/ and
click on the link to the Student Portal. Important information may be
sent by mail to their official address in Australia, and it will be assumed
that they have received this information.

Attend All Scheduled Classes

It is a condition of students’ enrolment that they attend all scheduled
classes, except where there is a legitimate and acceptable reason for
non-attendance e.g., illness supported by a Doctor’s Certificate (see
Section 2 Chapter 20). Overseas students whose attendance regularly
falls below 90% (even with Doctor’s Certificates) may be reported to the
Department of Home Affairs.

Missing Classes – Explanation of Absence

If students miss between 1 – 5 days of classes, they must complete an
Explanation of Absence form while informing their teacher. The form is
located on the Forms page of the Current Student Hub website:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms

Students are required to submit the form with an official medical
certificate, or other official documentation recognised as
Compassionate or Compelling evidence. All supporting documentation
must be in English or translated into English by a certified translator.

If illness is the cause of absence, medical certificates must be provided
from a local health provider who is AHPRA registered. Overseas medical
certificates will not be accepted. A copy of the policy can be found on
UNSW College's website under 'Policies'. Students may also refer to the
Student Guide for Special Consideration, located in the Appeals section
here: https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms/.

By submitting this form, a student’s attendance
record will not be adjusted. However, these forms
will be taken into consideration if the attendance
falls below 80% and the College is required to issue a
notification of ‘Intention to Report’ to the government.

Extended Absence – Leave of Absence

If students miss more than 5 days of classes, they
must complete a Leave of Absence form located on
the Forms page of the Current Student Hub website:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms with an official
medical certificate, or other official documentation
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling
evidence. All supporting documentation must be
in English or translated into English by a certified
translator.

If illness is the cause of absence, Medical certificates
must be from a health service provider from AHPRA
registered practitioners. Back-dated medical
certificates will not be accepted. A copy of the policy
can be found on UNSW College’s website under
‘Policies’:
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies.
This form must be submitted for approval from the
Head of Programs or Academic Head.

Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress

Students must maintain Satisfactory Academic
Progress (see Section 11). Overseas students
who fail to meet their visa conditions relating to
attendance and Satisfactory Academic Progress
must be reported to the Department of Home Affairs.

Speak English in Classes

Foundation Studies has a “Speak English in Classes”
rule. This is not only to ensure success in the
student's pathway to University but also to enable all
students and their teachers to be included in class
discussions.

Managing Own Conduct and Behaviour

Students are responsible for managing their own
conduct and behaviour, and for knowing the rules
concerning assessment, academic misconduct and
student misconduct (see Section 12).

Pay Your Fees

Students must pay all due fees as specified in their
Letter of Offer, and any other specified charges, on
or before the due dates applicable to each fee. It is
the student's own responsibility to ensure prompt
payment of fees and other charges due in respect of
their enrolment in the Foundation Studies program.
Responsibility cannot be transferred to another party
unless an approved scholarship or other payment
arrangements have been agreed to by Foundation
Studies. Failure to pay all due fees may result in their
enrolment being cancelled.

Academic Guidance and Early Interventions

A student who is at risk of not meeting the academic
expectations of Foundation Studies programs will
in some cases receive a written warning and/or be
given notification of a formal interview with a Student
Progress Adviser from the Student Progress Team
regarding their poor progress.

It is expected that Foundation Studies students
will accept the offers of assistance and advice as
provided via early "at-risk" interventions, and during
interviews at the end of the formal examination
periods and as provided by Foundation Studies staff
throughout the program.

Compliance with UNSW
Foundation Studies Policies

On acceptance of an offer to study in Foundation
Studies, all students agree to abide by the UNSW
College Foundation Studies policies, procedures and
guidelines as published on the website
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies and
as contained in this Student Handbook. It is therefore
expected that all Foundation Studies students have
read and agree with all Foundation Studies policies,
procedures and guidelines. Further, it is expected that
all Foundation Studies students will seek clarification
if they are unsure about any Foundation Studies
policies, procedures or guidelines.

Failure to Attend Exams

Failure to Complete Assessment Tasks

Fit to Sit/Applying for Special Consideration
due to Illness or Misadventure

We strongly recommend that all students read
the Student Guide to Special Consideration,
located under Appeals section here:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms/

This Student Guide will ensure students know
what is expected of them, should they fail to
attend an exam due to illness or misadventure,
fail to complete assessment tasks on time, or be
unable to sit an exam.

A direct link to the guide may be found here:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/wp-content/
uploads/Student-Guide-to-Special-Consideration-
May-2024.pdf

Failure to Attend Examinations

If a student is absent from an examination, they must
apply  for Special Consideration must be submitted
within 3 working days of the exam due date (refer to
dates in Moodle or the course outline)The form can

be found on the page here:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms.

Students should include all official documentation
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling
evidence to support their request, e.g., medical
certificates from a health service provider from
AHPRA registered practitioners.

All supporting documentation must be in English or
translated into English by a certified translator. Back-
dated medical certificates will not be accepted. The
Student Guide to Special Considerationn can also be
found on the page:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms.

Failure to Complete Assessment Tasks

Failure to complete, or to make a serious attempt
at any formal assessment task, may result in
an Unsatisfactory-Failure grade, irrespective of
marks awarded in other assessment components
of a course. This rule applies to all assessment
components including laboratory work, studio work,
projects, assignments, presentations, essays and
examinations. Failure to satisfactorily complete,
or to make a serious attempt at any assessment
component of the program may result in No Award of
the Foundation Studies Certificate.

Fit to Sit/Applying for Special Consideration
due to Illness or Misadventure

Students are responsible for deciding before an
assessment start time whether they are unwell, or
facing significant circumstances which will impact
their performance in that assessment or exam.

•  By sitting the exam or accessing a timed
assessment (eg final exam/quiz) on the
scheduled assessment date, you are declaring
that you are fit to do so and therefore cannot
later apply for Special Consideration.

•

Sitting or accessing an assessment task on
the scheduled assessment date, after applying
for special consideration, renders the special
consideration application void.

•  A student who becomes unwell during an

examination can request Special Consideration if

request for a calculation check of final exam marks
will advise the Student of the outcome, with either a
change or no change to final results. Students may
apply for a calculation check after they receive their
Statement of Final Results. The application can be
made within 10 calendar days of the publication
date of the Statement of Final Results. To make
an application students should use the Calculation
Check of Exam Marks form located on the Current
Student Hub website, Forms page.

Note:

•

Students must make sure they are present at all
scheduled examinations and assessment tasks.

•  Misreading the timetable is not an acceptable

excuse for lateness or failure to attend.

•

•

•

Some courses include other forms of
assessment such as laboratory work, projects,
tutorial exercises, assignments, presentations or
tests.

Students must make sure that they have
completed all the required forms of assessment.

It is not an excuse that they failed to attend
a lecture or class where instructions or work
were given or did not consult the relevant email,
message, or website notice.

•  Penalties will be applied for late submission of

assignments.

•

Students may request a Calculation Check after
Term 1 for subjects that are completed after
the first term. Students can only request a review
of results (including Term 1 subjects only) at the
end of their Foundation Studies Program.

they stop working on the examination, notify the
Examination Supervisor immediately and provide
a medical certificate dated within 24 hours of the
examination.

•

Exceptions will be dealt with on a case-by-case
basis where it is clear that a student was unfit to
make reasonable judgement on their fitness to
undertake the assessment, due to mental illness
or other extenuating circumstances.

If you are unavoidably absent, or you believe
your performance during an assessment and/
or examination has been adversely affected by
sickness, serious family concerns or any other
reason, you should apply for Special Consideration
using the Request for Special Consideration Due
to Illness or Misadventure on the forms page here:
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms

Again, the application should be made three days
before the assessment and no later than three days
after the date of the assessment and/or examination.

Students should include all official documentation
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling
evidence to support their request, e.g., medical
certificates from a health service provider from
AHPRA registered practitioners, and screenshots
or photos of any technical issues including date
stamps. All supporting documentation must be
in English or translated into English by a certified
translator. A copy of the policy can be found on
UNSW College’s website under ‘Policies’:
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies

The application for consideration of
illness/misadventure is evaluated. In most cases,
one of the following actions is taken:

1.  The application is noted, but no further action is
taken; if they are absent from the examination, a
mark of zero, or an Unsatisfactory-Failure grade
is given.

2.  Other assessment components are re-weighted
at the end of the course, to arrive at a final grade.

3.  A supplementary examination is given.

Supplementary Examination

1.  A supplementary examination is only given for

fully documented and compelling reasons, such
as serious medical problems. It is not given
merely to resolve borderline performance.

2.  A supplementary examination will not normally
be given in cases where a student has a poor
performance or attendance record or has failed
to complete other assessment components in
any course.

3.  The format of the supplementary examination

may differ from the original.

4.  Before an offer of a supplementary examination
is made, students may be required to attend and
perform satisfactorily in an oral test in the course
area.

You should note:

1.  The lodging of an application for consideration of
illness/misadventure does not guarantee that a
supplementary examination will be given.

2.  Supplementary examination details and request
outcomes will be notified to students via the
school email. It is the student’s responsibility
to check their school email account regularly to
avoid missing the details of the supplementary
examination. Students should contact the UNSW
College Student Enquiries as soon as possible
but within three working days to submit the
application.

3.  Any supplementary examination will usually

take place within or soon after the advertised
examination period. It is the student’s
responsibility to be available during this period.
Travel bookings, holiday plans or employment
obligations are not acceptable reasons for
absence from any examination.

Calculation Check of Final Exam Marks

For quality control, exams are marked by multiple
teachers to ensure a panel approach to each
paper, to try and avoid individual errors. Marks are
then checked multiple times to ensure results are
calculated correctly. If you believe your exam marks
have not been calculated correctly, you may request
a review of that calculation. The calculation check
is not a remark of your submission but a search
for accuracy of mark entry and calculation. The

Satisfactory
Academic Progress

UNSW College Student Progress Team, together with
teachers, monitor student academic progress using
a range of formal and informal measures. These
measures include:

1.  Diagnostic tests in Mathematics and English

2.  Performance in formal examinations

3.  Performance in other assessment tasks

4.  Tutorial performance as observed by the

classroom teacher

These measures of student academic performance
guide decisions on whether and when academic
intervention is necessary. Students are encouraged
to seek advice as early as possible and actively
participate in interventions to maximise their
opportunity to achieve satisfactory course progress.

Unsatisfactory Academic Progress

International students who fail to meet their visa
conditions relating to satisfactory course progress
will be notified in writing of the intention of UNSW
College to report them to the Department of Home
Affairs (DHA). The student has 20 working days from
the date of the notification within which to access the
UNSW College complaints and appeals process. A
student will have their enrolment cancelled if they are
reported to DHA for unsatisfactory course progress.

Australian Citizens and Permanent Residents with
unsatisfactory attendance and/or fail to achieve
satisfactory course progress may have their
Foundation Studies enrolment cancelled.

Performance Improvement Plan

Students are responsible for participating in learning
activities, completing coursework and submitting
assessments. The following actions have been
successfully used by students to improve their
academic performance:

•  Prepare thoroughly for classes and commit to

ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS

3. Formal Interventions

regular revision

•

Seek advice and assistance from their classroom
teacher when needed.

•  Attend weekly Course Consultations to receive

assistance with coursework.

•  Participate in Study Club to further develop
academic, study and communication skills.

•  Attend workshops and consultations offered by

the Student Progress Team.

•

Students can join the Conversation Club to
improve their confidence in communicating in
English.

Students should keep a personal record of
performance improvement activities they complete
so they can reflect on what has worked for them. This
record will also provide evidence that the student has
actively participated in the recommended support
and academic interventions.

In response to performance in Term and/or Final
Assessment.

After the publication of assessment results for
each term, or mid-term assessment in the case of
the Transition Program, students who receive more
than two Fail (F) and/or Unsatisfactory Fail (UF)
grades will be considered at risk of failing to achieve
Satisfactory Course Progress.

The student will be sent a letter via their UNSW
College email address notifying them that they are
“At Risk of Failing to Achieve Satisfactory Course
Progress”.

This letter will recommend that the student
implements a Performance Improvement Plan,
invites the student to discuss their progress with
Student Support and academic staff, and outlines
the student’s visa obligations regarding academic
performance. A student may be advised to repeat
all or part of the program or transfer to a different
program that is more suited to their capability. A copy
of this letter is placed in the student’s file.

1. Early Intervention

In response to diagnostic tests in Mathematics and
English.

Diagnostic tests in Mathematics and English
examine elementary literacies and basic course
knowledge required for successful completion of the
course.

Students who score below a minimum score on
these diagnostic tests are issued with a letter
advising them of ways to improve their performance
in the relevant course. A copy of the letter is placed in
the student’s file.

Recommended student actions include:

•  Commitment to thorough preparation and regular

revision

•  Attendance at weekly Course Consultations or

Workshops

•  Participation in Study Club

2. Informal Interventions

In response to coursework and participation in class
activities.

Academic staff may determine that a student's
performance does not meet expectations as
measured by performance on coursework tasks,
formative assessments or as measured by the
teacher in classroom interactions with the student.

This case-by-case analysis will usually result in
an informal (written or verbal) recommendation
for a student to implement one or more of the
performance improvement actions such as
regularly attending course consultations to receive
personalised help from course experts.

Academic Misconduct
& Student Misconduct

UNSW College is committed to improving and
transforming the lives of its students through
educational excellence. Underpinning this
commitment is a responsibility to uphold the
principles of academic integrity.

The principles of academic integrity help to guide
academic activities at the College (e.g., learning and
assessment). Students will find the principles of
academic integrity in the UNSW College Academic
Integrity Policy.

Students are expected to adhere to the principles
of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility,
and courage. It is the responsibility of all students
to uphold these values in their own work and when
drawing on the work and contributions of others.

Academic integrity is important to the future success
of all students.

A Breach of Academic Integrity
(Academic Misconduct)

A breach of academic integrity is any behaviour or
attempted behaviour that may result in an unfair
academic advantage to one or more students.
Breaches of academic integrity are considered to be
academic misconduct and treated seriously by the
College.

The College Academic Integrity Policy defines types
of academic misconduct that include, but are not
limited to, the following:

•  Plagiarism

•

•

Text recycling (self-plagiarism)

Fabrication and falsification (misrepresentation
through documentation)

•  Collusion

•

Exam cheating

•  Contract cheating

•

Impersonation

•  Bribery

•  Non-ethical and non-responsible use of
technology, including the use of artificial
intelligence.

•

Information about academic integrity will be
made available in the Course Outline, teaching
materials, student support services and
orientation.

Examples of Academic Misconduct

Academic Misconduct

Definitions and Examples

Copying

Submitting work for assessment or publication that is not one’s own. Plagiarism
includes:

•  Directly copying any materials from electronic or print resources without

acknowledging the original source of the work and/or using quotation marks
to indicate a direct quote.

•  Closely paraphrasing sentences or whole paragraphs without referencing the

original source of the work.

•  Using the ideas and concepts of another person or large language model

(LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT) without acknowledging and citing the original work of
the person or LLM.

Recycling
(self-plagiarism)

Submitting prior assessed work or building on a previous submission from a
course. Examples that do not constitute recycling include:

•  Permission from a teacher to submit prior work, with a condition to

acknowledge the extent and nature of the work used.

•

The submission of appropriate references from prior research used for a
student’s research thesis or publication.

Fabrication or
Falsification

The intentional act to misrepresent academic work. Fabrication and falsification
can include:

•  Making up information for an assessment such as experimental or interview

data.

•

Inventing sources of data, evidence, or ideas by citing publications that are
irrelevant or do not exist.

•  Making false declarations about attendance, participation and/or

assessment items to meet course requirements.

•  Misrepresentation through documentation. This consists of an intentional

act to alter or fabricate a document to obtain an advantage in assessment or
benefit enrolment. For example, a student falsifying a medical certificate to
receive an academic concession.

Collusion

Engaging in illegitimate, unauthorised collaboration with other students to
complete an assessment task. Collusion can involve:

•  Working with another student to produce an assessment task, without

receiving authorisation from a teacher, course outline or assessment guide.

•

•

Submitting assessment work with the knowledge that other students
contributed to an assessment or parts of an assessment, without receiving
prior permission to engage in collaborative work.

Submitting work that is the same, or similar to other students work for the
same assessment task. Except where written authorisation from a teacher is
clearly recorded in a course outline or assessment guide.

39

40

Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025

Cheating in
Examinations

Engaging in dishonest practice or breaching examination rules set by the College
in or during an examination. This can include:

•  Writing notes on one’s body or taking non-authorised examination materials

(unapproved calculators or textbooks) into an exam room.

•  Copying information from other students and/or communicating with other
students or people (except for an authorised exam invigilator) outside an
exam room.

•  Using electronic devices to access information related to an exam while the

exam is in progress.

•  Completing an examination without an invigilator.

Contract cheating

Involves outsourcing a whole assessment, or part of an assessment, to a third
party for a fee, no payment, other remuneration or benefit. This practice can
include:

•

•

•

Submitting an assessment item produced wholly or in part by a commercial
service.

Submitting an assessment item that was produced wholly or in part by
another person.

Submitting an assessment item that was produced or modified wholly, or in
part, by an artificial intelligence tool, algorithm, or computer generator where
such actions are not authorised in the guidelines for assessment.

•  Promoting the use of a commercial service to other students to create

assessment solutions.

•

Engaging in file-sharing of learning and teaching materials, including sharing
intellectual property of UNSW College.

A form of outsourcing assessment and represents a breach of academic
integrity. Impersonation involves a third party undertaking an examination or
other assessment on behalf of a student.

Can consist of two (2) forms: 1) offering bribes or inducements to gain an
academic advantage and 2) accepting bribes or inducement to give an academic
advantage.

Impersonation

Bribery

Inappropriate use of
Artificial Intelligence

Involves using, generating, and communicating information that is processed
by machines or computer systems for the completion of assessment in an
unethical, dishonest, and irresponsible manner.

Roles, Responsibilities and Processes

Maintaining academic integrity is the responsibility of all UNSW College students. Students must understand
the requirements of academic integrity and promote a culture of academic integrity among their fellow
students. To find out more about academic integrity, including information about academic penalties, please

Assignment and Project Policy

Late Assignment and Project Policy

1.  Assignments, essays and projects may have a
cover sheet specific to each course which will
be supplied by the students’ teacher. The cover
sheet may include:

Marks may be deducted at the rate of 10% of the
total mark available for each day late up to 10
working days. Normal Illness/Misadventure Affecting
Assessment procedures will apply.

Extensions of time for submission of assignments
and projects may be granted only in the most unusual
circumstances and must be applied before the due
date. Requests for extensions received after the due
date of assignments, will not be accepted.

Student identification number
•
•
Tutorial group
•  Name of tutor
•  Assignment title
•  Due date
•  Number of words
•  A declaration/signature acknowledging
source material and verifying that the
assignment is the student’s own work.

2.  Students must retain a copy of each assignment.

3.  Projects and assignments developed for

assessment in one course are not to be used
either in full or in part for assessment in any
other course.

4.  Students may be charged with academic

misconduct if they submit a formal assessment
task or project knowing it to be their own work
‘self-plagiarism’ or the work of another person,
unless the work done has been documented and
justified, or is required to be done by an expert.

Rules and Procedures for Studio and
Design Studies Assessments

General Information

•

 Students may be charged with academic
misconduct if they submit a project knowing it
to be wholly or partially the work or the ideas of
another person.

•  All students must attend all design classes

throughout the program and be present at the
scheduled commencement time for each class.

Failure to Submit Completed Design
Projects on Time

•

•

•

In addition to working during Studio classes,
it is expected that students will also work
independently on the projects outside Studio, in
their own time (minimum of 6 hours per week).
This applies to the Term 2 Design Studies
project.

For Design Studio and Term 2 Design studies,
all students must upload their creative work into
the digital workbook at least one hour before
commencement of class for the teacher to check
the work in advance. Students must be prepared
(including having materials ready) each week to
continue working on projects through class time.

Students are to check the Student Material List
which is on Moodle in Course Overview and
ensure they have the correct model-making
equipment at the beginning of the course. Note,
Design Skills videos on Moodle discuss materials
and equipment in more detail.

•

•

•

•

If students are late submitting work, they must
lodge a Request for Special Consideration Due
to Illness or Misadventure within three days,
providing a reason for their lateness or absence.

Lateness or failure to submit work at the
specified time, on the due date if the deadline is
missed is likely to result in zero marks or a UF
grade being given.

It is the responsibility of the student to contact
the Design Co-ordinator within three days of
the deadline regarding submission of the work.
Failure to do this will result in a zero mark being
awarded.

Students are advised that the lodging of
an application for consideration of illness/
misadventure does not guarantee that their
reason will be accepted as valid.

Submission of Design Studio and Design
Studies Projects

•

There are four assessable projects (two studio
projects in Term One, one studio project in Term
Two and one Design Studies project in Term 2)
that need to be executed throughout the program
and submitted through the Assessment area in
Moodle. Further information is in the learning
guides and will be provided during classes in the
weeks preceding the due submission date for
each project.

•  All projects must be submitted on the due date,
at the scheduled commencement time of the
class. If there is a valid issue that means a
student is unable to submit on time, this needs to
be discussed with the teacher in advance.

Warnings on Applying directly to Universities or
Using Agents!

•  Please be aware that all Australian universities

verify individual student performance in
Foundation Studies.

•  Do not attempt to falsify academic results or gain
admission to university by fraudulent means.
Any fraud or misrepresentation will be reported
to the Police and to the Department of Home
Affairs (DHA) which controls immigration and
student visas. Serious penalties apply, including
cancellation of student visas and deportation
from Australia.

•  Do not seek the services of agents, or pay fees

Release of
Academic Results

Release of Academic Results

https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/student-support/
getting-your-official-academic-documents-
transcripts/

Foundation Studies Programs use My eQuals to issue
academic transcripts and academic credentials to
students.

My eQuals is used by universities throughout Australia
and New Zealand, and is accepted internationally. It
allows students to securely share their documents
online with anyone, including employers and other
universities by providing a link (and password) so they
can view a verified copy of the academic documents
online.

If you prefer not to receive your documents via My
eQuals and would like printed copies instead, this can
be arranged. Please note that processing will take 3-8
weeks, depending on the delivery location. To opt out,
you will need to send us an email to
Enquiries@unswcollege.edu.au to confirm it in
writing and complete the Request for Official
Document Form (You can find the form on the page
here) before your results are released to advise that
you want printed copies of your results, instead of
using My eQuals. We will process your request once
we receive your form by email and you will get a
confirmation email once your printed results have
been posted to your nominated address.

Attendance
Monitoring

Foundation Studies Attendance Monitoring
and Reporting Procedure

1.  Students are expected to attend all classes and

lectures.

2.  Electronic class rolls are marked and regular

formal attendance checks are conducted during
the program. Consistent lateness to class is
also taken into consideration when determining
attendance levels. Absences and extent of
lateness are recorded electronically and included
in the calculation of attendance whether or
not medical certificates are provided by way of
explanation.

3.  Students are asked to complete relevant

documentation and Explanation of Absence
forms in relation to absence for any reason.
These are kept with student files for reference
and correspondence with the relevant authorities.

4.  Attendance is important in relation to student

visa conditions and for entry to other programs,
or requests to repeat a program. All original
medical certificates explaining absences should
be kept.
Note: Medical certificates must be from a
health service provider from AHPRA registered
practitioners. Back-dated medical certificates will
not be accepted.

5.

6.

If students are absent for an extended period
or are required to return home for any reason
they are required to inform the Student Enquiries
Office as soon as possible.

Information regarding attendance may be
provided to a parent, guardian or sponsor if
specifically requested, or if there is a reasonable
concern for the health or wellbeing of a student
in the program. If a student has an objection to
this policy the matter may be discussed with a
senior academic staff member.

7.  Students can check their attendance on the

student portal.

attendance for the program will be considered to
have failed to achieve Satisfactory Attendance.

Overseas students who fail to meet their visa
conditions relating to attendance will be notified
in writing via your official Foundation Studies
email address, of the intention to report the
student to the Department of Home Affairs.

This written notice will inform the student
that they can access the Foundation Studies
complaints and appeals process and have 20
working days in which to do so. All students on
an International student visa who are reported
to DHA for unsatisfactory attendance may have
their enrolment cancelled. Australian Citizens
and Permanent Residents of Australia who fail to
achieve Satisfactory Attendance may also have
their enrolment in a Foundation Studies Program
cancelled.

Unsatisfactory Attendance

1.  The requirement for maintaining Satisfactory

Attendance applies to all students in Foundation
Studies programs, including Australian Citizens
and Permanent Residents of Australia. This
policy is also consistent with the requirements
for student visas issued by the DHA.

2.  The requirement for Satisfactory Attendance
is that a student must attend at least 80%
of scheduled contact hours (with or without
medical certificates), for the program.

3.  The purpose of determining whether a student
is maintaining Satisfactory Attendance is to
alert students, teachers and Student Wellbeing
Advisers as early as possible to any problems
that may prevent the student from satisfactorily
completing the Program. With early intervention,
the more serious consequences of a student’s
continued poor attendance may be prevented.

4.  Students who have attendance of less than 85%
or students who have been absent for more than
five consecutive days without approval, will be
considered at risk of not being able to achieve
Satisfactory Attendance and will be formally
notified via an email to your official Foundation
Studies email address. A copy of this notification
will be placed on the student’s file.

5.  Warning and counselling will be provided for

students considered at risk of not being able to
achieve Satisfactory Attendance. Where possible
the Student Wellbeing Advisers will interview and
counsel all students deemed to be at risk.

6.  Students who are no longer able to achieve 80%

you do well in your first year at UNSW you may be able to apply for an internal transfer. Contact the Faculty for
advice.

How do I request to repeat?
Complete the ‘Request to Repeat’ form, available from the Current Student Hub using the link here

Guidelines

UNSW College is committed to delivering a high standard of education and training services to all of its students. One way
that UNSW College fulfils this commitment is by ensuring that all students (both domestic and international) have access
to a robust and fair complaints and appeals process. The Complaints and Appeals Policy can be found on the UNSW
College website under ‘Our Policies’.

The process for how complaints and appeals are dealt with under the Complaints and Appeals Policy is extracted below.

Stage 1: Informal Complaint Process

You are encouraged to attempt to resolve issues that arise informally, by contacting either the
original decision maker, Student Enquiries or a Student Wellbeing Adviser. This should be done as
soon as possible after the issues arise.

Examples of informal complaints include:

•

•

•

late return of assessment results

disagreement over marks

teacher quality feedback

•  wrong information provided by staff

•  wrong COE issued

•  wrong attendance recorded

•

•

•

•

•

customer service feedback

class and timetabling changes

facilities/Wi-Fi complaints

complaints about homestay providers

complaints about airport pickups

University life is a wonderful opportunity for you to
discover new people, new ideas, new experiences
and new passions. Along with your academic
learning journey, we strongly encourage all students
to participate in some of the many social and extra-

faculty societies. There are many avenues to explore
one's interests. Further, ARC provides excellent
resources to students, ranging from legal support
and translation services, to free food and student
discounts. ARC is located in the main quad on
campus and all students are welcome to drop in. You
will be greeted by friendly fellow students.

College offers a range of leadership opportunities for
students to develop their personal capabilities. These
include:

The SRC is a peak representative body of
approximately 10 students from across various
UNSW College programs. The SRC meets weekly
to consult on student matters, planning campus
events and experiences designed to promote student
engagement and participation. As an SRC member,
students will learn to collaborate to deliver campus
events, as well as develop interpersonal development
skills, presentation skills, communications and
marketing, and social media.

SRC recruits new students three times per year.

Equitable
Learning Support

https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/support-category/
equitable-learning/

If you have a disability, learning difficulty or
experiencing health/mental health issues and require
individual support while you study with us, please
let us know as soon as possible by contacting the
Student Wellbeing Team at:
els@unswcollege.edu.au.

Do I have to share information regarding my
disability or medical condition?
It is your choice whether you share information with
UNSW College with regards to disability or health/
mental health condition, however, if you choose not
to share this information with UNSW College, we will
not be able to put in place an Equitable Learning Plan
for you.

If I provide my health information, how is it used?
In order to issue you with an Equitable Learning Plan
(ELP), you will be required to provide evidence of
disability, learning difficulty or other health issues.
This will typically be a medical professional report
which must include the following information:

Once you advise us that you require additional
support, due to disability or health condition, one of
our friendly Student Wellbeing Advisers will get in
contact with you to arrange a meeting in which you
can provide us with more information about the type
of support you might require and we will create an
Equitable Learning Plan (ELP).

What is included in my Equitable Learning Plan (ELP)
and who will see it:
Your Equitable Learning Plan which is shared with the
Academic Team such as your teachers and Exams
team if appropriate only includes information about
education adjustments and supports that have been
approved for you. It does not include your medical
diagnosis.

I have a disability, learning difficulty or health/
mental health condition impacting on my studies
what are the types of supports that can be offered to
me?
Again, support will vary for each student, depending
on your individual needs, but just to give you an idea
about which areas of your studies this support can
be provided please see list below:

- the nature and duration of your condition

- any treatment you are receiving

•

•

In class support

Examination and submitting assessments

- the impact disability or circumstances is having on
  your studies and exams

The supporting documentation must be:

- no longer than 2 years old

- in English or NAATI accredited translated copy and

- must be on official letterhead, signed and dated by
  an appropriate medical practitioner

- and must include a diagnosis and information about
  how it impacts on your learning

If you do not have current documentation and need
support with obtaining it please speak to a Student
Wellbeing Adviser.

•  Use of assistive technology

•  Referral to other support services

If I want to apply for Equitable Learning Plan, when
should I do this?
If you require individualised support due to disability
it is best to advise UNSW College as soon as you
accept your offer or within the first week of your
enrolment. Applying early means you can have
all necessary supports put in place from the very
beginning of your program.

What if my disability impacts my assessments or
exams?
Support is available for students who require this
in order to attempt and complete assessments and
exams. Please contact our Student Wellbeing Team
ahead of your assessments or exams so we can help
with preparation for necessary adjustments.

Students Care Program. As part of this program, you
are provided with a range of supports which have
been put in place in order to support and monitor
your welfare.

Regular Meetings with Student Wellbeing Advisers:
During those meetings, Student Wellbeing Advisers
will discuss with students all matters related to their
studies, their health and wellbeing, social life as
well as accommodation. Those meetings are also
an opportunity for students to ask any questions or
concerns they may have. Student Wellbeing Advisers
can also make referrals to other support services
such as a doctor or a counsellor. Student Wellbeing
Advisers work closely with academic and student
accommodation providers.

Accommodation Assistance:
U18 Students issued with CAAW can only stay
in Accommodation approved by UNSW College.
However, if students are not satisfied with their
current accommodation or are experiencing any

issues Accommodation Team can assist in resolving
those issues and if required, assist with changing
accommodation.

Transition to UNSW Process:
U18 students who remain U18 at the commencement
of the UNSW Program will be provided with
assistance with planning for the gap between
programs, securing approved accommodation for the
commencement of University as well as providing
students with information regarding any seminars
they need to attend before commencing at UNSW as
an Under 18 students.

After Hours Emergency Support:
All Under 18 students can access support not
only during business hours but also after hours.
Students requiring emergency support after hours
are advised to contact their accommodation
provider's emergency number. If the matter is
serious Accommodation provider will contact UNSW
College Student Wellbeing Staff who is On Call so
comprehensive support can be provided to the
student in need.

Liaising with Parents:
Student Wellbeing Advisers will liaise with your
parents regarding important matters related to
your course progress and attendance as well
as any health and welfare-related issues and
accommodation matters. Parents wishing to contact
Student Wellbeing Advisers should email:
student.support@unswcollege.edu.au

Are there any specific rules U18 students who are
issued with CAAW must follow?
Yes, students must follow a set of rules which have
been put in place to support their safety and welfare.
Those rules include things like the time students
have to return to their accommodation, rules about
visitors as well as rules regarding attending regular
meetings with Student Wellbeing Adviser. Those
rules are discussed at Orientation and student’s
first meeting with a Student Wellbeing Adviser. It is
important that you follow those rules. If you breach
any of the CAAW rules your CAAW may be cancelled
which may result in cancellation of your student visa.
