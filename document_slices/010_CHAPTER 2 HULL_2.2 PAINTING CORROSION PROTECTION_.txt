2.2.2.4 Surface Cleaning Before Over-Coating  
The surfaces shall be cleaned of oil, moisture, dust, and other foreign materials with thinner, fresh water, wire brush, or compressed air prior to coating.  
2.2.3 PAINTING WORK  
The painting shall be carried out by airless spray, in general. Where the spraying is impracticable, the brush or roller shall be used.  
**The first full coat shall be spray, then roller and brush can be used. Roller and brush can be used in difficult and narrow area.**  
Mixing and thinning of paint material, conditions/methods of application and minimum and maximum over coating time of painting application shall be in accordance with paint manufacturer's recommendation and data sheets.  
Free-edges of steel members which have been gas cut and welding slag remains shall be ground in accordance with the Builder's practice, WBT as per PSPC.  
After the first coat one (1) stripe coat shall be applied on the edges of holes, scallops and frames in fresh water tanks and water/weather-exposed areas as well as cargo holds behind and between cell guides in accordance with the Builder’s practice. The stripe coat colour same with the full coat colour.  
Watertight weld lines by manual welding shall be painted after air test has been finished, but adhesive tape and touch up of shop-primer may be performed during painting application.  
2.2.4 INSPECTION OF THE FILM THICKNESS  
**Paint work will not start unless a block has been accepted or a written waiver is given by the Buyer’s representative.**  
**For the paint, date of manufacture, batch number, shelf life and expiry dates to be provide as per paint maker’s standard.**  
**Paint samples will be taken by Buyer’s site team and sent to paint Maker factory for analysis to confirm Maker’s formula is used.**  
The checking of final paint dry film thickness shall be carried out by the Builder in the presence of Buyer's representative and paint manufacturer.  
Measuring  
The cleaning condition and dry film thickness between coats shall be inspected by two (2) parties, the Builder and the paint maker. **Builder will provide daily schedule to Buyer’s site office in the morning time.** The Buyer will carry out the patrolling inspection.  
In general, two (2) separate spot measurements shall be made over every 10 m2 in tanks, and for each 20 m2 in other spaces. The average of five (5) separate spot measurements must be within the specified thickness. For PSPC areas and fresh water and technical water tanks areas, rule 90%-90% shall apply as acceptance criteria for DFT measurement. **Total**  
**DFT specified in painting schedule shall be attained in at least 85% of the painted area and balance 15% measured should be not less than 85% of specified DFT.**  
In any measurement there is a certain level of uncertainty. Two inspectors using the same gage will not necessarily record the exact same number for given spot measurement. To allow for this natural fluctuation, an individual spot measurement is permitted to be below the 85% of specified minimum thickness, however The average of the means(3 points in the same 4cm diameter circle) shall not be less than the specified 85% of minimum thickness.  
No measurement shall be made for about 100mm breadth from free edges of painted steel members, machinery, equipment, outfitting, pipes with nominal diameter of 250 mm and below, pipe supports, machinery seats, small fittings, etc.  
***Dry Film thickness always to be measured at every stage of coating, final confirm will be done after anti-corrsion paint finish.***  
2.2.5 control  
2.2.5.1 Painting Work  
Mixing and thinning of paint material, conditions/methods of application and time interval between each coat shall be observed to the paint manufacturer's recommendation.  
Paint works shall not be performed in the open air during the periods of rain, snow, fog or mist and also shall not be carried out when the weather conditions may cause condensation i.e., relative humidity above 85% and steel temperature is lower than the dew point by three (3) degrees in centigrade except the case that paint maker has confirmed that a particular paint can be applied at such weather condition.  
During coating processes, when dispute happen, the final arbitration shall come from the painting maker.  
**Any condition deviation from Paint’s MDS for application in relation to RH and Steel temperature must be given by Maker’s Office in writing and stamped. E-Mail correspondence is not acceptable.**  
2.2.5.2 Dry Film Thickness  
In general, two (2) spot measurements for each 10 m2 in tanks and holds, and for each 20m2 in other spaces shall be measured.
