METADATA: {'Header 1': 'CHAPTER 7 AUTOMATION AND REMOTE CONTROL', 'Header 2': '**7.2.7** Control of Air Compressors'}
--------------------
1. Starting of main air compressors  
The starting of main air compressors shall be automatically ON/OFF controlled, depending on pressure of common inlet pipe of the main air reservoirs in the following sequence:  
- At abt. 2.8 MPa – start the first leading main air compressor  
- At abt. 2.6 MPa – start the second leading main air compressor (operating both compressors)  
- All compressors stop at 3.0 MPa  
Any compressor can be selected as first leading, second leading.  
The main air compressor shall be automatically started and stopped by detecting the pressure of common inlet pipe of main air reservoirs. The relocation of start/stop setting points shall be possible.  
A common failure alarm for automatic tripping shall be sent to alarm and monitoring system (AMS). Safety installation for the compressors shall be provided in accordance with the maker's recommendation.  
Hour counter of each compressor shall be provided in control board.  
A remote control for the main air compressors shall be arranged.  
Main air compressor auto/start/stop switch and running indication to be provided in ECC  
2. Control air treatment station  
Control air installation shall be supplied from air treatment station with pressure 0.8MPa  
The air treatment station shall be supplied from main air reservoir by means of reduction valve 3.0 / 0.8 MPa and consists of:  
- Air dehydrator  
- Reduction valve and safety valve  
- Pressure gauge at each pressure output
