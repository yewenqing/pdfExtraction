Academic Information 
for Students
 
Foundation Studies  
Programs, Streams & Courses
Programs
Foundation Studies Programs provide academic preparation for 
undergraduate study and are designed for international students. The 
programs are delivered in lecture and tutorial format along with practical 
laboratory, workshop and studio classes as well as weekly consultations 
with the instructor. A Student Progress Coordinator will be monitoring 
student progress and will be able to provide students with individual 
study advice and tips throughout the duration of their program. 
On completion of a Foundation Studies program, students are  
awarded a Foundation Studies Certificate, which is accepted by  
UNSW and all Australian universities for undergraduate entry. Academic 
standards and results in the programs are approved and monitored by 
UNSW and its Faculties. The Certificate is accompanied by a Statement 
of Results.
There are three main Foundation Studies programs.
The Standard Foundation Program is delivered over 9 months.
The Standard Plus Foundation Program is delivered over 12 months and 
designed for students who require a more gradual introduction to their 
studies.
The Transition Program is a 4-month, one-term program designed for 
international students who have completed a previous high school 
matriculation program and have academic results just below that 
required for direct entry to UNSW.
Streams and Courses
Within each Foundation Studies Program, students must choose a 
Stream (set program of courses) determined by their desired university 
program.
The Transition Program offers the Physical Science, Life Science, 
Commerce, Design and Actuarial Streams only. Streams and courses at 
Foundation Studies Kensington campus are shown in Table 1.
All streams contain five to seven courses; each course has a unit of 
credit weighting. Students usually take a minimum of 48 units of credit.

Permanent Resident (PR) &  
Australian Citizen Status
6
Permanent Resident (PR) and Australian 
Citizen Status
Students who have Permanent Resident (PR) or 
Australian citizen status can complete a Foundation 
Studies program. Foundation Studies policies, rules 
and regulations apply to all students irrespective 
of their nationality or residency status. The normal 
tuition fee applies.
Students who change their status from that of 
international student to PR or Australian citizen, must 
notify the UNSW College Student Enquiries Office and 
also the Student Wellbeing Advisers immediately. 
Failure to do so may affect university admission.
Based on the Foundation Studies results, PR and 
Australian Citizen students may apply for a university 
place. Application is made through the Universities 
Admissions Centre (UAC), along with all other 
Australian citizens sitting final exams such as the 
NSW Higher School Certificate. Entry levels that apply 
for New Year and Mid-Year entry are determined by 
UAC at the time of each intake and are dependent 
on the availability of places. The GPA requirements 
for UNSW may be higher and sometimes lower than 
that of international students for some programs. 
The Student Wellbeing Advisers will hold meetings to 
advise PR and Australian Citizens of the procedures 
for admission to university through UAC.
Please note that some universities will only accept 
the Foundation Studies Certificate for entry from 
international, non-resident students.
The University of New South Wales accepts the 
Foundation Studies Certificate for entry from 
international students and Australian Citizens or 
Australian Permanent Residents.
Please note that in some Faculties, there are NO 
Commonwealth Supported Places - CSP (previously 
known as HECS places) available for students in 
Term 2 or 3 because they have all been allocated to 
students in the Term 1 intake.  
Not all UNSW undergraduate programs are offered in 
Terms 2 and 3. 
All students should check the UNSW website to 
confirm their undergraduate degree will commence in 
time for the completion of their Foundation Studies 
program as on some occasions there may be term 
delay between the completion of Foundation Studies 
and commencement of an undergraduate program.
Section One: Academic Information for Students

Student 
Responsibilities
Follow the UNSW College Student Code  
of Conduct
The UNSW College Student Code of Conduct serves 
as a guide to help all students understand the 
expectations for their behavior whilst enrolled at the 
College.
It outlines the standards for academic integrity, 
respect for others, and the consequences for actions 
that go against these principles.
Here are the key purposes:
Promote a positive learning environment. 
The code ensures that everyone in the school 
community can learn and work in a safe, respectful, 
and supportive atmosphere.
Define Acceptable Behaviour.  
It clearly states what is considered appropriate and 
inappropriate behavior, helping students know how to 
act responsibly and respectfully towards others.
Protect the Rights of All Students. 
By setting out rules, the code helps protect students 
from discrimination, harassment, bullying, and other 
forms of misconduct.
Encourage Responsibility and Accountability. 
It teaches students to take responsibility for their 
actions and understand the consequences of 
breaking the rules.
Support Academic Integrity. 
The code includes guidelines on academic honesty, 
such as prohibiting cheating or plagiarism, to ensure 
fairness and integrity in academic work.
By understanding and following the Student Code of 
Conduct, students can contribute to a positive and 
productive College experience.

Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025
Check Your UNSW Student Email Daily
UNSW and UNSW College communicate with students via email. Official 
communication with students will always be via their UNSW student 
email account. UNSW College will use the student’s official GID email 
address to contact them.
It is the student’s responsibility to check their official UNSW student 
email account regularly for important information. Ignorance is no 
excuse if relevant information and details have been sent to them by 
email, or handed out at lectures or on the website.
Provide Your Current Address Details
Students must inform us within 7 days of their arrival in Australia of their 
correct residential address and phone contact details and must advise 
any later changes of address or contact details within 7 days. This is a 
condition of their student visa. 
Students must do this online at https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/ and 
click on the link to the Student Portal. Important information may be 
sent by mail to their official address in Australia, and it will be assumed 
that they have received this information.
Attend All Scheduled Classes
It is a condition of students’ enrolment that they attend all scheduled 
classes, except where there is a legitimate and acceptable reason for 
non-attendance e.g., illness supported by a Doctor’s Certificate (see 
Section 2 Chapter 20). Overseas students whose attendance regularly 
falls below 90% (even with Doctor’s Certificates) may be reported to the 
Department of Home Affairs.
Missing Classes – Explanation of Absence
If students miss between 1 – 5 days of classes, they must complete an 
Explanation of Absence form while informing their teacher. The form is 
located on the Forms page of the Current Student Hub website: 
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms
Students are required to submit the form with an official medical 
certificate, or other official documentation recognised as 
Compassionate or Compelling evidence. All supporting documentation 
must be in English or translated into English by a certified translator.
If illness is the cause of absence, medical certificates must be provided 
from a local health provider who is AHPRA registered. Overseas medical 
certificates will not be accepted. A copy of the policy can be found on 
UNSW College's website under 'Policies'. Students may also refer to the 
Student Guide for Special Consideration, located in the Appeals section 
here: https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms/. 
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
By submitting this form, a student’s attendance 
record will not be adjusted. However, these forms 
will be taken into consideration if the attendance 
falls below 80% and the College is required to issue a 
notification of ‘Intention to Report’ to the government.
Extended Absence – Leave of Absence
If students miss more than 5 days of classes, they 
must complete a Leave of Absence form located on 
the Forms page of the Current Student Hub website: 
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms with an official 
medical certificate, or other official documentation 
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling 
evidence. All supporting documentation must be 
in English or translated into English by a certified 
translator.
If illness is the cause of absence, Medical certificates 
must be from a health service provider from AHPRA 
registered practitioners. Back-dated medical 
certificates will not be accepted. A copy of the policy 
can be found on UNSW College’s website under 
‘Policies’:  
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies. 
This form must be submitted for approval from the 
Head of Programs or Academic Head.
Maintain Satisfactory Academic Progress
Students must maintain Satisfactory Academic 
Progress (see Section 11). Overseas students 
who fail to meet their visa conditions relating to 
attendance and Satisfactory Academic Progress 
must be reported to the Department of Home Affairs.
Speak English in Classes
Foundation Studies has a “Speak English in Classes” 
rule. This is not only to ensure success in the 
student's pathway to University but also to enable all 
students and their teachers to be included in class 
discussions.
Managing Own Conduct and Behaviour
Students are responsible for managing their own 
conduct and behaviour, and for knowing the rules 
concerning assessment, academic misconduct and 
student misconduct (see Section 12).
Pay Your Fees
Students must pay all due fees as specified in their 
Letter of Offer, and any other specified charges, on 
or before the due dates applicable to each fee. It is 
the student's own responsibility to ensure prompt 
payment of fees and other charges due in respect of 
their enrolment in the Foundation Studies program. 
Responsibility cannot be transferred to another party 
unless an approved scholarship or other payment 
arrangements have been agreed to by Foundation 
Studies. Failure to pay all due fees may result in their 
enrolment being cancelled.
Academic Guidance and Early Interventions
A student who is at risk of not meeting the academic 
expectations of Foundation Studies programs will 
in some cases receive a written warning and/or be 
given notification of a formal interview with a Student 
Progress Adviser from the Student Progress Team 
regarding their poor progress.
It is expected that Foundation Studies students 
will accept the offers of assistance and advice as 
provided via early "at-risk" interventions, and during 
interviews at the end of the formal examination 
periods and as provided by Foundation Studies staff 
throughout the program.
Compliance with UNSW  
Foundation Studies Policies
On acceptance of an offer to study in Foundation 
Studies, all students agree to abide by the UNSW 
College Foundation Studies policies, procedures and 
guidelines as published on the website  
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies and 
as contained in this Student Handbook. It is therefore 
expected that all Foundation Studies students have 
read and agree with all Foundation Studies policies, 
procedures and guidelines. Further, it is expected that 
all Foundation Studies students will seek clarification 
if they are unsure about any Foundation Studies 
policies, procedures or guidelines.

accordance with the following rules and procedures:
1.	 Students must obey any instruction given by an 
examination supervisor for the proper conduct of 
the examination.
2.	 Students must present their student identification 
card at all examinations and leave this on their 
desk for the duration of the examination.
3.	 Students must be seated in their allocated place

supervision. No toilet breaks are allowed in the 
first half hour or the last 10 minutes.
9.	 All answers must be written in English unless 
otherwise stated.
10.	 Authorised materials: students are permitted 
to take pens, pencils, rulers and erasers into 
the examination room but are advised that all 
answers must be written in pen, except where 
expressly required. Pencils may be used only 
for multiple-choice answer sheets, drawing, 
sketching or graphical work.
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
11.	 All exam booklets and papers must be returned 
to the examiners. No exam booklets or papers 
may be removed from the exam room.
12.	 Students are not permitted to smoke or eat

Moodle-Based Examinations
Students will need a notebook or laptop to complete 
Moodle-based examinations. Students will need 
functioning headphones (Bluetooth or wired) to 
complete exams containing audio, such as Academic 
English, UEEC, etc.
Unauthorised Material
Students must not use any unauthorised materials 
during examinations. Examples of unauthorised 
materials are bags, motorcycle helmets, hats, caps or 
other headwear, calculators other than the approved 
one provided at enrolment, watches, electronic 
dictionaries, or word finders, writing paper, notes, 
manuscripts or books, pencil cases, food, cigarettes, 
music players, etc.
Mobile Phones
Students may bring a mobile phone to their 
examination workstation, but it must be switched off 
and placed under their seat during the examination. 
Students can only use their phones to authenticate 
their Moodle account under an invigilator's 
supervision. Students must not forget to take it 
when they leave. The use of a mobile phone or 
any other electronic communication device during 
examinations may be regarded as serious academic 
misconduct.
Use of Electronic Equipment
Students are required to use the Foundation Studies 
approved calculator which was provided to them 
at enrolment. They must bring this calculator to 
examinations where a calculator is allowed.
Do not bring any other calculator to the examination.
Breach of Rules
If a student commits any infringement of the rules 
governing examinations, they may be liable to 
disqualification at the particular examination, to 
immediate expulsion from the examination room 
and to further penalty as may be determined by 
the Foundation Studies Academic Misconduct 
Committee.
For the following sections: 
•	
Failure to Attend Exams
•	
Failure to Complete Assessment Tasks
•	
Fit to Sit/Applying for Special Consideration 
due to Illness or Misadventure 
We strongly recommend that all students read 
the Student Guide to Special Consideration, 
located under Appeals section here:  
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms/ 
  
This Student Guide will ensure students know 
what is expected of them, should they fail to 
attend an exam due to illness or misadventure, 
fail to complete assessment tasks on time, or be 
unable to sit an exam. 
  
A direct link to the guide may be found here: 
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/wp-content/
uploads/Student-Guide-to-Special-Consideration-
May-2024.pdf
Failure to Attend Examinations
If a student is absent from an examination, they must 
apply  for Special Consideration must be submitted 
within 3 working days of the exam due date (refer to 
dates in Moodle or the course outline)The form can 
be found on the page here:  
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms.
Students should include all official documentation 
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling 
evidence to support their request, e.g., medical 
certificates from a health service provider from 
AHPRA registered practitioners.
All supporting documentation must be in English or 
translated into English by a certified translator. Back-
dated medical certificates will not be accepted. The 
Student Guide to Special Considerationn can also be 
found on the page:  
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms.
Failure to Complete Assessment Tasks 
Failure to complete, or to make a serious attempt 
at any formal assessment task, may result in 
an Unsatisfactory-Failure grade, irrespective of 
marks awarded in other assessment components 
of a course. This rule applies to all assessment 
components including laboratory work, studio work, 
projects, assignments, presentations, essays and 
examinations. Failure to satisfactorily complete, 
or to make a serious attempt at any assessment 
component of the program may result in No Award of 
the Foundation Studies Certificate.
Fit to Sit/Applying for Special Consideration 
due to Illness or Misadventure
Students are responsible for deciding before an 
assessment start time whether they are unwell, or 
facing significant circumstances which will impact 
their performance in that assessment or exam. 
•	
By sitting the exam or accessing a timed 
assessment (eg final exam/quiz) on the 
scheduled assessment date, you are declaring 
that you are fit to do so and therefore cannot 
later apply for Special Consideration. 
•	
Sitting or accessing an assessment task on 
the scheduled assessment date, after applying 
for special consideration, renders the special 
consideration application void.
•	
A student who becomes unwell during an 
examination can request Special Consideration if 
33
Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025
34
Foundation Studies: Student Handbook 2025
they stop working on the examination, notify the 
Examination Supervisor immediately and provide 
a medical certificate dated within 24 hours of the 
examination. 
•	
Exceptions will be dealt with on a case-by-case 
basis where it is clear that a student was unfit to 
make reasonable judgement on their fitness to 
undertake the assessment, due to mental illness 
or other extenuating circumstances.
If you are unavoidably absent, or you believe 
your performance during an assessment and/
or examination has been adversely affected by 
sickness, serious family concerns or any other 
reason, you should apply for Special Consideration 
using the Request for Special Consideration Due 
to Illness or Misadventure on the forms page here: 
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/forms
Again, the application should be made three days 
before the assessment and no later than three days 
after the date of the assessment and/or examination. 
Students should include all official documentation 
recognised as Compassionate or Compelling 
evidence to support their request, e.g., medical 
certificates from a health service provider from 
AHPRA registered practitioners, and screenshots 
or photos of any technical issues including date 
stamps. All supporting documentation must be 
in English or translated into English by a certified 
translator. A copy of the policy can be found on 
UNSW College’s website under ‘Policies’:  
https://www.unswcollege.edu.au/about/policies
The application for consideration of  
illness/misadventure is evaluated. In most cases, 
one of the following actions is taken:
1.	 The application is noted, but no further action is 
taken; if they are absent from the examination, a 
mark of zero, or an Unsatisfactory-Failure grade 
is given.
2.	 Other assessment components are re-weighted 
at the end of the course, to arrive at a final grade.
3.	 A supplementary examination is given.
Supplementary Examination
1.	 A supplementary examination is only given for 
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
fully documented and compelling reasons, such 
as serious medical problems. It is not given 
merely to resolve borderline performance.
2.	 A supplementary examination will not normally 
be given in cases where a student has a poor 
performance or attendance record or has failed 
to complete other assessment components in 
any course.
3.	 The format of the supplementary examination 
may differ from the original.
4.	 Before an offer of a supplementary examination 
is made, students may be required to attend and 
perform satisfactorily in an oral test in the course 
area.
You should note:
1.	 The lodging of an application for consideration of 
illness/misadventure does not guarantee that a 
supplementary examination will be given.
2.	 Supplementary examination details and request 
outcomes will be notified to students via the 
school email. It is the student’s responsibility 
to check their school email account regularly to 
avoid missing the details of the supplementary 
examination. Students should contact the UNSW 
College Student Enquiries as soon as possible 
but within three working days to submit the 
application.
3.	 Any supplementary examination will usually 
take place within or soon after the advertised 
examination period. It is the student’s 
responsibility to be available during this period. 
Travel bookings, holiday plans or employment 
obligations are not acceptable reasons for 
absence from any examination.
Calculation Check of Final Exam Marks
For quality control, exams are marked by multiple 
teachers to ensure a panel approach to each 
paper, to try and avoid individual errors. Marks are 
then checked multiple times to ensure results are 
calculated correctly. If you believe your exam marks 
have not been calculated correctly, you may request 
a review of that calculation. The calculation check 
is not a remark of your submission but a search 
for accuracy of mark entry and calculation. The 
request for a calculation check of final exam marks 
will advise the Student of the outcome, with either a 
change or no change to final results. Students may 
apply for a calculation check after they receive their 
Statement of Final Results. The application can be 
made within 10 calendar days of the publication 
date of the Statement of Final Results. To make 
an application students should use the Calculation 
Check of Exam Marks form located on the Current 
Student Hub website, Forms page.
Note:
•	
Students must make sure they are present at all 
scheduled examinations and assessment tasks.
•	
Misreading the timetable is not an acceptable 
excuse for lateness or failure to attend.
•	
Some courses include other forms of 
assessment such as laboratory work, projects, 
tutorial exercises, assignments, presentations or 
tests.
•	
Students must make sure that they have 
completed all the required forms of assessment.
•	
It is not an excuse that they failed to attend 
a lecture or class where instructions or work 
were given or did not consult the relevant email, 
message, or website notice.
•	
Penalties will be applied for late submission of 
assignments.
•	
Students may request a Calculation Check after 
Term 1 for subjects that are completed after 
the first term. Students can only request a review 
of results (including Term 1 subjects only) at the 
end of their Foundation Studies Program.

Satisfactory  
Academic Progress
11
UNSW College Student Progress Team, together with 
teachers, monitor student academic progress using 
a range of formal and informal measures. These 
measures include:
1.	 Diagnostic tests in Mathematics and English 
2.	 Performance in formal examinations 
3.	 Performance in other assessment tasks
4.	 Tutorial performance as observed by the 
classroom teacher
These measures of student academic performance 
guide decisions on whether and when academic 
intervention is necessary. Students are encouraged 
to seek advice as early as possible and actively 
participate in interventions to maximise their 
opportunity to achieve satisfactory course progress.
Unsatisfactory Academic Progress
International students who fail to meet their visa 
conditions relating to satisfactory course progress 
will be notified in writing of the intention of UNSW 
College to report them to the Department of Home 
Affairs (DHA). The student has 20 working days from 
the date of the notification within which to access the 
UNSW College complaints and appeals process. A 
student will have their enrolment cancelled if they are 
reported to DHA for unsatisfactory course progress.
Australian Citizens and Permanent Residents with 
unsatisfactory attendance and/or fail to achieve 
satisfactory course progress may have their 
Foundation Studies enrolment cancelled.
Performance Improvement Plan
Students are responsible for participating in learning 
activities, completing coursework and submitting 
assessments. The following actions have been 
successfully used by students to improve their 
academic performance: 
•	
Prepare thoroughly for classes and commit to 
regular revision 
•	
Seek advice and assistance from their classroom 
teacher when needed.
•	
Attend weekly Course Consultations to receive 
assistance with coursework.
•	
Participate in Study Club to further develop 
academic, study and communication skills.
•	
Attend workshops and consultations offered by 
the Student Progress Team.
•	
Students can join the Conversation Club to 
improve their confidence in communicating in 
English.
Students should keep a personal record of 
performance improvement activities they complete 
so they can reflect on what has worked for them. This 
record will also provide evidence that the student has 
actively participated in the recommended support 
and academic interventions.
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
ACADEMIC INTERVENTIONS
1. Early Intervention
In response to diagnostic tests in Mathematics and 
English.
Diagnostic tests in Mathematics and English 
examine elementary literacies and basic course 
knowledge required for successful completion of the 
course.
Students who score below a minimum score on 
these diagnostic tests are issued with a letter 
advising them of ways to improve their performance 
in the relevant course. A copy of the letter is placed in 
the student’s file.
Recommended student actions include:
•	
Commitment to thorough preparation and regular 
revision 
•	
Attendance at weekly Course Consultations or 
Workshops
•	
Participation in Study Club
2. Informal Interventions
In response to coursework and participation in class 
activities.
Academic staff may determine that a student's 
performance does not meet expectations as 
measured by performance on coursework tasks, 
formative assessments or as measured by the 
teacher in classroom interactions with the student.  
This case-by-case analysis will usually result in 
an informal (written or verbal) recommendation 
for a student to implement one or more of the 
performance improvement actions such as 
regularly attending course consultations to receive 
personalised help from course experts.
3. Formal Interventions
In response to performance in Term and/or Final 
Assessment.
After the publication of assessment results for 
each term, or mid-term assessment in the case of 
the Transition Program, students who receive more 
than two Fail (F) and/or Unsatisfactory Fail (UF) 
grades will be considered at risk of failing to achieve 
Satisfactory Course Progress. 
The student will be sent a letter via their UNSW 
College email address notifying them that they are 
“At Risk of Failing to Achieve Satisfactory Course 
Progress”.
This letter will recommend that the student 
implements a Performance Improvement Plan, 
invites the student to discuss their progress with 
Student Support and academic staff, and outlines 
the student’s visa obligations regarding academic 
performance. A student may be advised to repeat 
all or part of the program or transfer to a different 
program that is more suited to their capability. A copy 
of this letter is placed in the student’s file.

Academic Misconduct  
& Student Misconduct
12
UNSW College is committed to improving and 
transforming the lives of its students through 
educational excellence. Underpinning this 
commitment is a responsibility to uphold the 
principles of academic integrity. 
The principles of academic integrity help to guide 
academic activities at the College (e.g., learning and 
assessment). Students will find the principles of 
academic integrity in the UNSW College Academic 
Integrity Policy.
Students are expected to adhere to the principles 
of honesty, trust, fairness, respect, responsibility, 
and courage. It is the responsibility of all students 
to uphold these values in their own work and when 
drawing on the work and contributions of others.
Academic integrity is important to the future success 
of all students.
A Breach of Academic Integrity  
(Academic Misconduct)
A breach of academic integrity is any behaviour or 
attempted behaviour that may result in an unfair 
academic advantage to one or more students. 
Breaches of academic integrity are considered to be 
academic misconduct and treated seriously by the 
College.
The College Academic Integrity Policy defines types 
of academic misconduct that include, but are not 
limited to, the following:
•	
Plagiarism
•	
Text recycling (self-plagiarism)
•	
Fabrication and falsification (misrepresentation 
through documentation)
•	
Collusion
•	
Exam cheating
•	
Contract cheating
•	
Impersonation
•	
Bribery
•	
Non-ethical and non-responsible use of 
technology, including the use of artificial 
intelligence.
•	
Information about academic integrity will be 
made available in the Course Outline, teaching 
materials, student support services and 
orientation.  
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
Examples of Academic Misconduct
Academic Misconduct
Definitions and Examples
Copying
Submitting work for assessment or publication that is not one’s own. Plagiarism 
includes:
•	
Directly copying any materials from electronic or print resources without 
acknowledging the original source of the work and/or using quotation marks 
to indicate a direct quote. 
•	
Closely paraphrasing sentences or whole paragraphs without referencing the 
original source of the work. 
•	
Using the ideas and concepts of another person or large language model 
(LLM) (e.g., ChatGPT) without acknowledging and citing the original work of 
the person or LLM. 
Recycling  
(self-plagiarism)
Submitting prior assessed work or building on a previous submission from a 
course. Examples that do not constitute recycling include:
•	
Permission from a teacher to submit prior work, with a condition to 
acknowledge the extent and nature of the work used. 
•	
The submission of appropriate references from prior research used for a 
student’s research thesis or publication. 
Fabrication or 
Falsification
The intentional act to misrepresent academic work. Fabrication and falsification 
can include: 
•	
Making up information for an assessment such as experimental or interview 
data. 
•	
Inventing sources of data, evidence, or ideas by citing publications that are 
irrelevant or do not exist. 
•	
Making false declarations about attendance, participation and/or 
assessment items to meet course requirements. 
•	
Misrepresentation through documentation. This consists of an intentional 
act to alter or fabricate a document to obtain an advantage in assessment or 
benefit enrolment. For example, a student falsifying a medical certificate to 
receive an academic concession.
Collusion
Engaging in illegitimate, unauthorised collaboration with other students to 
complete an assessment task. Collusion can involve:
•	
Working with another student to produce an assessment task, without 
receiving authorisation from a teacher, course outline or assessment guide. 
•	
Submitting assessment work with the knowledge that other students 
contributed to an assessment or parts of an assessment, without receiving 
prior permission to engage in collaborative work. 
•	
Submitting work that is the same, or similar to other students work for the 
same assessment task. Except where written authorisation from a teacher is 
clearly recorded in a course outline or assessment guide.

Rules and Procedures for Studio and 
Design Studies Assessments
General Information
•	
All students must attend all design classes 
throughout the program and be present at the 
scheduled commencement time for each class.
•	
In addition to working during Studio classes, 
it is expected that students will also work 
independently on the projects outside Studio, in 
their own time (minimum of 6 hours per week). 
This applies to the Term 2 Design Studies 
project.
•	
For Design Studio and Term 2 Design studies, 
all students must upload their creative work into 
the digital workbook at least one hour before 
commencement of class for the teacher to check 
the work in advance. Students must be prepared 
(including having materials ready) each week to 
continue working on projects through class time.
•	
Students are to check the Student Material List 
which is on Moodle in Course Overview and 
ensure they have the correct model-making 
equipment at the beginning of the course. Note, 
Design Skills videos on Moodle discuss materials 
and equipment in more detail.
Submission of Design Studio and Design 
Studies Projects
•	
There are four assessable projects (two studio 
projects in Term One, one studio project in Term 
Two and one Design Studies project in Term 2) 
that need to be executed throughout the program 
and submitted through the Assessment area in 
Moodle. Further information is in the learning 
guides and will be provided during classes in the 
weeks preceding the due submission date for 
each project.
•	
All projects must be submitted on the due date, 
at the scheduled commencement time of the 
class. If there is a valid issue that means a 
student is unable to submit on time, this needs to 
be discussed with the teacher in advance.
•	
 Students may be charged with academic 
misconduct if they submit a project knowing it 
to be wholly or partially the work or the ideas of 
another person.
Failure to Submit Completed Design 
Projects on Time
•	
If students are late submitting work, they must 
lodge a Request for Special Consideration Due 
to Illness or Misadventure within three days, 
providing a reason for their lateness or absence. 
•	
Lateness or failure to submit work at the 
specified time, on the due date if the deadline is 
missed is likely to result in zero marks or a UF 
grade being given.
•	
It is the responsibility of the student to contact 
the Design Co-ordinator within three days of 
the deadline regarding submission of the work. 
Failure to do this will result in a zero mark being 
awarded. 
•	
Students are advised that the lodging of 
an application for consideration of illness/
misadventure does not guarantee that their 
reason will be accepted as valid.

online.
If you prefer not to receive your documents via My 
eQuals and would like printed copies instead, this can 
be arranged. Please note that processing will take 3-8 
weeks, depending on the delivery location. To opt out, 
you will need to send us an email to  
Enquiries@unswcollege.edu.au to confirm it in 
writing and complete the Request for Official 
Document Form (You can find the form on the page 
here) before your results are released to advise that 
you want printed copies of your results, instead of 
using My eQuals. We will process your request once 
we receive your form by email and you will get a 
confirmation email once your printed results have 
been posted to your nominated address.
Warnings on Applying directly to Universities or 
Using Agents!
•	
Please be aware that all Australian universities 
verify individual student performance in 
Foundation Studies.

Foundation Studies Attendance Monitoring 
and Reporting Procedure
1.	 Students are expected to attend all classes and 
lectures.
2.	 Electronic class rolls are marked and regular 
formal attendance checks are conducted during 
the program. Consistent lateness to class is 
also taken into consideration when determining 
attendance levels. Absences and extent of 
lateness are recorded electronically and included 
in the calculation of attendance whether or 
not medical certificates are provided by way of 
explanation.
3.	 Students are asked to complete relevant 
documentation and Explanation of Absence 
forms in relation to absence for any reason. 
These are kept with student files for reference 
and correspondence with the relevant authorities.
4.	 Attendance is important in relation to student 
visa conditions and for entry to other programs, 
or requests to repeat a program. All original 
medical certificates explaining absences should 
be kept.  
Note: Medical certificates must be from a 
health service provider from AHPRA registered 
practitioners. Back-dated medical certificates will 
not be accepted. 
5.	 If students are absent for an extended period 
or are required to return home for any reason 
they are required to inform the Student Enquiries 
Office as soon as possible.
6.	 Information regarding attendance may be 
provided to a parent, guardian or sponsor if 
specifically requested, or if there is a reasonable 
concern for the health or wellbeing of a student 
in the program. If a student has an objection to 
this policy the matter may be discussed with a 
senior academic staff member.
7.	 Students can check their attendance on the 
student portal.
Attendance  
Monitoring
Section Two: Rules, Regulations & Policies
Unsatisfactory Attendance
1.	 The requirement for maintaining Satisfactory 
Attendance applies to all students in Foundation 
Studies programs, including Australian Citizens 
and Permanent Residents of Australia. This 
policy is also consistent with the requirements 
for student visas issued by the DHA.
2.	 The requirement for Satisfactory Attendance 
is that a student must attend at least 80% 
of scheduled contact hours (with or without 
medical certificates), for the program. 
3.	 The purpose of determining whether a student 
is maintaining Satisfactory Attendance is to 
alert students, teachers and Student Wellbeing 
Advisers as early as possible to any problems 
that may prevent the student from satisfactorily 
completing the Program. With early intervention, 
the more serious consequences of a student’s 
continued poor attendance may be prevented.
4.	 Students who have attendance of less than 85% 
or students who have been absent for more than 
five consecutive days without approval, will be 
considered at risk of not being able to achieve 
Satisfactory Attendance and will be formally 
notified via an email to your official Foundation 
Studies email address. A copy of this notification 
will be placed on the student’s file.
5.	 Warning and counselling will be provided for 
students considered at risk of not being able to 
achieve Satisfactory Attendance. Where possible 
the Student Wellbeing Advisers will interview and 
counsel all students deemed to be at risk. 
6.	 Students who are no longer able to achieve 80% 
attendance for the program will be considered to 
have failed to achieve Satisfactory Attendance.
Overseas students who fail to meet their visa 
conditions relating to attendance will be notified 
in writing via your official Foundation Studies 
email address, of the intention to report the 
student to the Department of Home Affairs.
This written notice will inform the student 
that they can access the Foundation Studies 
complaints and appeals process and have 20 
working days in which to do so. All students on 
an International student visa who are reported 
to DHA for unsatisfactory attendance may have 
their enrolment cancelled. Australian Citizens 
and Permanent Residents of Australia who fail to 
achieve Satisfactory Attendance may also have 
their enrolment in a Foundation Studies Program 
cancelled.

Guidelines
UNSW College is committed to delivering a high standard of education and training services to all of its students. One way 
that UNSW College fulfils this commitment is by ensuring that all students (both domestic and international) have access 
to a robust and fair complaints and appeals process. The Complaints and Appeals Policy can be found on the UNSW 
College website under ‘Our Policies’. 
The process for how complaints and appeals are dealt with under the Complaints and Appeals Policy is extracted below.
Student Complaints  
& Appeals Process
Stage 1: Informal Complaint Process
You are encouraged to attempt to resolve issues that arise informally, by contacting either the 
original decision maker, Student Enquiries or a Student Wellbeing Adviser. This should be done as 
soon as possible after the issues arise.
Examples of informal complaints include:
•	
late return of assessment results
•	
disagreement over marks
•	
teacher quality feedback
•	
wrong information provided by staff
•	
wrong COE issued
•	
wrong attendance recorded
•	
customer service feedback
•	
class and timetabling changes
•

refer the matter to an external body for an independent review (see section 9 of the Complaints and 
Appeals Policy).
If you commence an external appeal, so that your enrolment can be maintained during the appeal 
process, you must inform us in writing by emailing: 
enrolments@unswcollege.edu.au and complaintsandconduct@unswcollege.edu.au

Social Events, Activities and  
Clubs on Campus
University life is a wonderful opportunity for you to 
discover new people, new ideas, new experiences 
and new passions. Along with your academic 
learning journey, we strongly encourage all students 
to participate in some of the many social and extra-
curricular opportunities that are available to all 
students, every week at the L5 building and on the 
main campus. 
For a look at what’s on at UNSW College, we 
encourage you to visit the Current Student Hub 
website:  
https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/whats-on/
UNSW has an active Student Union called ARC which 
all Foundation Students are encouraged to join and 
participate in: https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/
ARC has hundreds of clubs and societies; from 
sports teams to media, from arts and culture to 
faculty societies. There are many avenues to explore 
one's interests. Further, ARC provides excellent 
resources to students, ranging from legal support 
and translation services, to free food and student 
discounts. ARC is located in the main quad on 
campus and all students are welcome to drop in. You 
will be greeted by friendly fellow students.
Leadership Opportunities
To complement your academic journey, UNSW 
College offers a range of leadership opportunities for 
students to develop their personal capabilities. These 
include:
1) Student Representative Council (SRC) 
The SRC is a peak representative body of 
approximately 10 students from across various 
UNSW College programs. The SRC meets weekly 
to consult on student matters, planning campus 
events and experiences designed to promote student 
engagement and participation. As an SRC member, 
students will learn to collaborate to deliver campus 
events, as well as develop interpersonal development 
skills, presentation skills, communications and 
marketing, and social media. 
SRC recruits new students three times per year. 
Applicants are encouraged to apply with their CV 
and cover letter to src@unswcollege.unsw.edu.au 
Successful candidates will be invited to participate in 
an interview with fellow SRC members, and Student 
Experience team staff members.
2) Student Volunteers 
Student Volunteers play an integral role in supporting 
new students during orientation days and welcome 
weeks. They support students with campus tours, 
making new friends, and providing general advice to 
new students to help them settle into their studies. 
Interested students can contact  
volunteers@unswcollege.edu.au to get involved in 
the program and help others.
3) Student Internships 
The paid internship program is a valuable opportunity 
for current students who wish to gain work 
experience and build their professional profiles 
whilst studying at the College. It is a maximum 
term of 3 months program that covers four different 
disciplines:
•	
Events
•	
Communications
•	
Customer Service
•	
Social Media Marketing.
Interested students are encouraged to email their 
CVs and cover letters to intern@unswcollege.edu.au 
to apply for the roles.
4) Peer-Assisted Learning Support (Study Club)
Former Foundation Studies students with exceptional 
GPA scores may apply to become Peer Leaders at

Studies students with their coursework and 
homework.

https://my.unswcollege.edu.au/support-category/
equitable-learning/
If you have a disability, learning difficulty or 
experiencing health/mental health issues and require 
individual support while you study with us, please 
let us know as soon as possible by contacting the 
Student Wellbeing Team at:  
els@unswcollege.edu.au.
Do I have to share information regarding my 
disability or medical condition? 
It is your choice whether you share information with 
UNSW College with regards to disability or health/
mental health condition, however, if you choose not 
to share this information with UNSW College, we will 
not be able to put in place an Equitable Learning Plan 
for you.
If I provide my health information, how is it used?  
In order to issue you with an Equitable Learning Plan 
(ELP), you will be required to provide evidence of 
disability, learning difficulty or other health issues. 
This will typically be a medical professional report 
which must include the following information: 
- the nature and duration of your condition
- any treatment you are receiving
- the impact disability or circumstances is having on 	
	 your studies and exams
The supporting documentation must be: 
- no longer than 2 years old
- in English or NAATI accredited translated copy and
- must be on official letterhead, signed and dated by 	
	 an appropriate medical practitioner
- and must include a diagnosis and information about 	
	 how it impacts on your learning
If you do not have current documentation and need 
support with obtaining it please speak to a Student 
Wellbeing Adviser.
Once you advise us that you require additional 
support, due to disability or health condition, one of 
our friendly Student Wellbeing Advisers will get in 
contact with you to arrange a meeting in which you 
can provide us with more information about the type 
of support you might require and we will create an 
Equitable Learning Plan (ELP).
What is included in my Equitable Learning Plan (ELP) 
and who will see it: 
Your Equitable Learning Plan which is shared with the 
Academic Team such as your teachers and Exams 
team if appropriate only includes information about 
education adjustments and supports that have been 
approved for you. It does not include your medical 
diagnosis.
I have a disability, learning difficulty or health/
mental health condition impacting on my studies 
what are the types of supports that can be offered to 
me?  
Again, support will vary for each student, depending 
on your individual needs, but just to give you an idea 
about which areas of your studies this support can 
be provided please see list below:
•	
In class support 
•	
Examination and submitting assessments
•	
Use of assistive technology
•	
Referral to other support services
If I want to apply for Equitable Learning Plan, when 
should I do this? 
If you require individualised support due to disability 
it is best to advise UNSW College as soon as you 
accept your offer or within the first week of your 
enrolment. Applying early means you can have 
all necessary supports put in place from the very 
beginning of your program.
What if my disability impacts my assessments or 
exams? 
Support is available for students who require this 
in order to attempt and complete assessments and 
exams. Please contact our Student Wellbeing Team 
ahead of your assessments or exams so we can help 
with preparation for necessary adjustments.
