METADATA: {'Header 1': 'CHAPTER 6 MACHINERY', 'Header 2': '6.6 STEAM GENERATING PLANT', 'Header 3': '6.6.1 GENERAL'}
--------------------
The steam generating plant shall consist of one (1) composite boiler with oil fired section and exhaust gas section utilizing the heat of main engine exhaust gas. The exhaust gas section of the composite boiler shall act as main engine exhaust silencer and the noise attenuation shall be as per Maker’s standard.  
The composite boiler shall be vertical cylinder welded construction smoke/water tube boiler.  
The normal necessary steam at sea shall be generated by the exhaust gas section of the composite boiler, utilizing the exhaust gas heat of the main engine at CSR .  
The construction of the composite boiler shall be in accordance with Maker’s standard and having adequate access for cleaning and inspection.  
The fuel oil burning equipment and feed water regulating (on/off control) of the composite boiler shall be provided and operated automatically.  
The exhaust gas section of the composite boiler shall be capable of dry-running in emergency condition in accordance with Maker’s recommendation.  
The simultaneous operation of the oil fired section and exhaust gas section of the composite boiler shall be made when the vessel is operated in the lower temperature area or reduced power operation of the main engine.  
Excess steam shall be led to the atmospheric condenser via a dump (F.W. cooled).  
***Steam production by exhaust gas side of the composite boiler to be measured during sea trials.***  
***Exhaust gas side of the composite boiler to be fitted with in and out thermometers and a gauge to measure the pressure drop across.***  
***Boiler Hot well must be equipped with Oil monitor and salinity monitors as standard.***  
***Boiler must also be able to operate on MGO EU directive 2005/53/EC.***
