| Heat and sound insulation | ***Rock wool (abt.100 kg/m3) or Glass wool (abt.40 kg/m3)*** |
| Fire insulation | Ceramic fiber ***(as per maker's standard )*** |  
#### 3.2.2.1 Fire Insulation  
Fire insulation shall be provided according to requirements of SOLAS.  
#### 3.2.2.2 Heat Insulation  
The parts of steel walls and decks of compartment in accommodation space exposed to weather shall be insulated in accordance with the following table:  
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Material | Application |

Sound insulation shall be provided in Air conditioning unit room, Engine control room and E/R fan rooms.  
Detailed solutions of sound isolation shall be decided based on results of noise analysis and prediction during detail design stage.  
#### 3.2.2.4 Coverage of Insulation  
The surface of insulation material shall be covered with as follows:  
|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Material | Application |
| Glass cloth | Protected insulation by wall/ceiling panels or galvanized steel sheet |
| Glass cloth coated with aluminum foil | Unprotected insulation, which is covered by neither wall/ceiling panels nor galvanized steel sheet |
