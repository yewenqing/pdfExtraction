1. Air conditioning plant  
Two (2) sets of refrigerating plant, which to be R-407C direct expansion and electric motor driven, shall be installed, and each capacity shall be ***60%*** of total.  
Each plant shall consist of:  
One (1) – Compressor  
Electric motor driven, reciprocating or scroll type with manual start/stop, automatic unloading  
One (1) – Condenser  
Horizontal straight shell and tube type,  
One (1) - Gas dryer  
Leakage detector also shall be provided.Air handling unit  
One (1) set of air handling unit (100% capacity) shall be installed in air conditioning unit room.  
The unit shall consist of:  
One (1) - Ventilation fan  
Single speed, electric motor driven, centrifugal type,  
One (1) – Heating coil chamber.  
One (1) - Cooling coil chamber,  
One (1) - Humidifying fresh water spay nozzle for humidifying,  
One (1) - Fresh air and air recirculation air mixing chamber with two (2) manual dampers,  
One (1) - Removable air filter.  
The accessories such as pressure gauge and thermometer shall be provided in accordance with the Maker’s standard.  
Piping system  
Cooling fresh water for condenser shall be supplied from the L.T. cooling fresh water system in engine room.  
Temperature control system  
Automatic temperature controller shall be fitted.  
In summer, the supply air temperature from air handling unit shall be automatically controlled by expansion valve in AHU and compressor unloading mechanism in compressor.  
In winter, steam regulating valve shall be controlled by a temperature sensor located in the main supply duct. Fresh water will be used for humidity.  
In mild climates when cooling or heating is not required, the system to serve as mechanical ventilation for the accommodations, supplying fresh air only.  
The temperature in each room shall be manually controlled by means of adjustment of air flow rate at each diffuser.  
Ducting system  
Fresh air for the air handling unit shall be drawn through the air supply head and shall be let to the central unit.  
Recirculation air for the air handling unit shall be drawn through the grill provided on the wall or ceiling of the corridor space and shall be led to the air handling unit.  
Air conditioning supply ducts shall be pre-insulated spiral or rectangle duct made of galvanized steel sheet.  
The air conditioning supply ducts shall be carried into each room and terminated with ceiling type controllable diffuser and galvanized louvers in spot cooling spaces.  
Necessary damper shall be fitted to main branches at easy accessible locations.  
Non-return flaps and fire dampers shall be installed in accordance with the requirement of the rules.  
Drainage of water shall be arranged from the lowest points of the ducts.  
Easy access for inspection and service for fire closing and balancing dampers is to be provided.  
Air supply line to hospital shall be provided with non-return damper and an individual exhaust fan.  
Test and trial  
The air handling unit shall be tested at the Maker's shop in accordance with the Maker's usual practice.  
After the completion of air conditioning system, following tests shall be performed in accordance with Builder's practice.  
1. Air volume test  
2. Cooling or heating test  
The air conditioning test shall be carried out as applicable in connection with testing season. When the heating or cooling is not applicable, only the running test shall be performed.
