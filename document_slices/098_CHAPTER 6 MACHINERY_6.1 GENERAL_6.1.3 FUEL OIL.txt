METADATA: {'Header 1': 'CHAPTER 6 MACHINERY', 'Header 2': '6.1 GENERAL', 'Header 3': '6.1.3 FUEL OIL'}
--------------------
HFO and LSHFO/ULSFO and MGO shall be on board as fuel.  
The main engine shall be capable of burning HFO of up to viscosity of 700cSt/50˚C, max. density of 1,010kg/m3 at 15˚C, and MGO shall be used prior stopping for long time only.  
The fuel oil piping system and equipment shall be designed with fuel oil viscosity of **380** cSt/50˚C.  
The main generator engines shall burn HFO and LSHFO/ULSFOsame as for main engine including the running condition of start, stop, MGO will be used when the engine is expected to be inactive for a prolonged period with cold engine.  
The emergency diesel generator shall be designed to burn MGO.  
Same heavy fuel oil used in the main engine shall be used for oil fired section of the composite boiler, and cold starting of the boiler shall burn MGO.  
However, when the ship is navigating to enter into a SOxemission control area, the burning fuel oil for engines and boiler shall be changed over to MGO or ULSFO (sulphur content 0.1 % m/m).  
The change over from HFO to LSHFO/ULSFO or MGO or vice versa will be automatic type.  
MGO cooler will be cooled by LT cooling fresh water.  
MGO will not be purified, and MDO will be used instead of MGO for MGO system function test.  
Fuel standard as follow:  
HFO: ISO 8217-2017(E), Class RMK380, Viscosity is 380 cSt/50oC (Sulfur content < 3.5% m/m), density 1,010 kg/m3 at 15 oC.  
MGO: ISO 8217-2017(E), Class DMZ, Viscosity is 3~6 cSt/40oC (Sulfur content <0.1% m/m)  
LSHFO (Sulfur content < 0.5% m/m, viscosity 10~70 cSt/50oC) is new hybrid fuel type that don’t fit into the ISO 8217 standard, and will be based on the available specification data from the fuel supplier.  
ULSFO (Sulfur content < 0.1% m/m, viscosity 10~60 cSt/50oC) is new hybrid fuel type that don’t fit into the ISO 8217 standard, and will be based on the available specification data from the fuel supplier.
