METADATA: {'Header 1': 'CHAPTER 8 ELECTRIC PART', 'Header 2': '**8.2.1** WIRING SYSTEM'}
--------------------
**All cables shall be marked at both ends with the cable reference numbers as per drawings. Marks shall be flame retardant with impressed letters. The individual conductor ends in the cables shall be marked with closed ring marks. All internal wiring in switchboards, panels, consoles, etc. shall also be marked with closed rings at both ends with reference numbers as per drawings. (according to maker standard)**  
The distribution system shall consist of three-phase AC. three-wire insulated system, single phase AC. two-wire insulated system and DC two-wire insulated system.  
The distribution system shall be as follows:
