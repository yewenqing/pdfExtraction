--------------------
Composite boiler  
No. of set : One (1)  
Type : Cylindrical vertical type with pressure atomizedburner and feed water regulator (on/off control).  
Evaporation  
Oil fired section : Abt.1,800kg/h, final capacity to be decided acc. to steam balance.  
Exhaust gas section : abt. 1,300 kg/h at CSR of M/E under ISO condition.  
Steam state : 0.7 MPa (working) saturated  
Feed water temperature : 80oC  
Fuel : HFO, LSHFO/ULSFO,MGO  
The exhaust gas section of the composite boiler also serves as M/E exhaust gas silencer and the noise attenuation shall be as per Maker’s standard.  
Final capacity to be decided acc. to final selected maker’s calculation.
